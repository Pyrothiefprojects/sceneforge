# Rules

- NEVER install software, packages, or dependencies on this machine (no brew, npm install, pip install, etc.)
- NEVER modify system configuration (git config, shell profiles, SSH keys, etc.)
- Ask before running any command that modifies anything outside the project directory
- NEVER commit or push to git — the user handles all git operations themselves
