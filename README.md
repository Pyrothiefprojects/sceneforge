## What It Is
Parallax is a browser-based point-and-click puzzle game editor and engine built entirely in vanilla JavaScript. It includes a visual editor for designing scenes, hotspots, inventory items, interactive puzzles, and game progression — and a built-in play mode for testing the whole thing as a player would experience it.

## How It Works
- Single HTML page — no frameworks, no bundler, no server required
- Visual editor with toolbar sections for Scenes, Hotspots, Inventory, Puzzles, Game State, and Image
- Scenes with polygon hotspot zones, multiple states, transition animations, and background music
- Unified action system shared across scene hotspots, puzzle hotspots, and puzzle assets
- Progression system with ordered hint steps tied to auto-generated flags
- Projects save/load as JSON; export produces deployment-ready `project-data.js` with path-based asset references
- Asset preloader with progress bar on startup

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** — single page shell
- **JavaScript** — engine, editor modules, all game logic (IIFE modules, no build step)
- **CSS** — dark theme UI (pyrothief.ca aesthetic)
- **Canvas API** — scene rendering, asset compositing, hotspot polygon drawing and hit-testing, ideogram editor
- **SVG** — puzzle hotspot rendering within puzzle overlays, connection lines
- **PNG / WebP / JPEG** — scene backgrounds, puzzle graphics, item icons, animation frames
- **MP4 / WebM** — optional video transitions for state changes
- **MP3 / WAV / M4A / AAC** — background music and sound effects (HTML5 Audio)
- **File System Access API** — save ruin images directly to disk (Chrome/Edge)

## Editor Features

- **[Scenes & Hotspots](docs/scenes-hotspots.md)** — scene management with states, scene assets with per-state positioning/visibility/layering, polygon hotspot drawing with popover config, hotspot connections, and the unified action system
- **[Inventory & Puzzles](docs/inventory-puzzles.md)** — item management with use counts, puzzle overlays with interactive asset placement and grouping, puzzle hotspots, multi-state puzzles, and puzzle asset types (combo lock, console terminal)
- **[Ideogram Editor](docs/ideogram-editor.md)** — ruin-based puzzle editor with asset codex, radial wheel placement, rotation/resize/color tools, ideogram drawing (lines, circles), cut tool (rectangle and polygon), text tool, IsoMark compositor, zoom, and the cypher tool (disc/spindial rotation puzzles with drag-to-rotate, dev lock, 3-tier coupling system, pin position with gate effects, and per-slot lock controls)
- **[Game State & Image](docs/gamestate-image.md)** — flags, progression hints, level overview, blueprint spatial planning editor with 6 placement tools, and image editor with 16:9 crop

## Play Mode
Press Play to enter game mode — the toolbar hides, floating overlay buttons appear, and the game fills the window. Right-click for a radial inventory wheel, interact with hotspots and puzzle assets, and follow the hint progression. Full details in [development docs](docs/development.md#play-mode).
