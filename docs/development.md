# Development

## Architecture
All modules use the IIFE revealing module pattern:
```js
const Module = (() => {
    // private state and functions
    return { /* public API */ };
})();
```
No build step, no imports — scripts load in dependency order via `<script>` tags. Module dependencies are resolved by load order in `index.html`.

## Play Mode

Press the **Play** button to enter play mode. The toolbar slides away and the game fills the full window:

- **Floating overlay buttons** — transparent Edit, Hint, and Inventory buttons float at the top-right corner of the game viewport
- **Radial inventory wheel** — right-click anywhere to open a circular wheel of collected inventory items; left-click an item to select it (cursor changes to item icon), click outside to dismiss; works in both the main scene and inside puzzle overlays
- **Cursor feedback** — default cursor for non-interactive areas, grab hand for interactive hotspots, item cursor when an item is selected
- **Inventory overlay** — click the inventory button to open a full grid panel; click an item to select it; click a hotspot that accepts that item to use it
- **Pick mode** — hotspots with move-asset actions enter pick mode: a ghost image follows the cursor, click a connected target hotspot to drop the asset there, ESC to cancel
- **Puzzle overlays** — open when a puzzle hotspot is clicked; interact with assets (rotate combo locks, type terminal commands, etc.); right-click to open the radial wheel inside puzzles
- **Dialogue box** — typewriter-animated text with frosted glass backdrop; click once to skip animation, click again to dismiss; action dialogues (pickup, accept item, move asset) auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, other dialogues auto-dismiss after 10 seconds; new dialogues immediately replace the current one
- **Hint system** — click the hint button to see the next hint from the progression list based on which flags the player has collected
- **State transitions** — hotspots and assets can trigger state changes with animated PNG frame sequences or embedded video transitions, swapping backgrounds and hotspot layouts
- **Loop animations** — continuously cycling frame overlays play on scene and puzzle hotspots, correctly scaled and positioned relative to the viewport
- **Background music** — scene music starts looping on the player's first click (browser autoplay restriction); crossfades smoothly when navigating to a scene with different music; stops when exiting play mode
- **Sound effects** — one-shot or looping audio plays when clicking hotspots, puzzle assets, or puzzle hotspots that have a sound assigned; looping sounds auto-stop on scene change or puzzle close
- **Clear after click** — one-time hotspots disappear after interaction (cursor no longer shows grab hand)
- **Clear group** — collecting an item clears all sibling hotspots across states that share the same item and spatially overlap, preventing duplicate collection
- **ESC** to close the radial wheel, exit pick mode, or return to edit mode (in that priority order)

## Animation Workflow
1. Create a transition video (e.g. cryo pod opening, door sliding) in any video tool or AI generator (Sora, etc.)
2. Rip the video into a PNG frame sequence using an external MP4-to-PNG converter (currently a local Java tool — planned as a built-in JS utility)
3. Use the **first frame** as the "before" state background and the **last frame** as the "after" state background — this keeps transitions visually seamless when navigating between states
4. Load the frame sequence into the state change transition panel and configure speed/reverse as needed
5. Optionally load the original video as an alternative to the PNG sequence (higher quality, larger file size)

This workflow ensures that state backgrounds match the transition endpoints exactly, so there's no visual pop when the animation starts or ends.

## Save / Load / Export
- **Save** — downloads a `parallax-project.json` file containing all scenes, items, puzzles, progression steps, images, animation frames, and videos (embedded as data URLs for portability)
- **Load** — upload a project JSON to restore the full editor state
- **Export** — generates `project-data.js` with path-based asset references instead of data URLs, ready for deployment alongside the asset files in `assets/`
- Includes backwards-compatible migration for older project formats

## Deployment
The exported game is fully static — no server-side code required.

1. **Export** the project from the editor (Export button in toolbar)
2. Place the exported `project-data.js` in `data/`
3. Place all asset files in the `assets/` folder structure matching the paths in the export
4. Host the entire folder on any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

On load, the preloader scans all asset URLs from `window.PARALLAX_PROJECT`, preloads every image, video, and audio file in parallel with a progress bar, then auto-starts play mode.

## Puzzle Design — Ruin Codex

### Spindial as Player Tool

The spindial is the player's primary tool throughout the game — it's issued at the start, never lost, and serves as key, map, and ID.

**Setup:**
- Player wakes in a cryopod. The cryo symbol is visible above the pod in its correct orientation — this is the player's reference throughout the game.
- Inside the cryopod is a plate. Insert the plate into a machine and it issues a spindial, pre-loaded with the cryo symbol.
- The cryo symbol means: you're cryo crew, you have the map to cryo operations, and the spindial unlocks cryo doors/terminals.

**Spindial interactions:**
- Unlocks doors
- Interacts with terminals
- Loads ruin plates (cards) found throughout the ship
- Each ruin plate is a piece of the ship map

**Puzzle flow:**
1. Player finds ruin plates during exploration (navigation, weapons, shield, engine, etc.)
2. Load a plate into the spindial via a terminal
3. Use the spindial on the cypher display (found in cryo operations, beside a terminal showing the cryo plate readout with all symbols)
4. The cypher displays only the ruins the player has collected — empty slots are visible so the player knows how many remain
5. All positions are available to cycle through regardless of how many ruins are loaded
6. Player arranges the collected ruins into correct positions and orientations to form the ideogram
7. The completed ideogram IS the full map of the ship structure

**Cryo as reference:**
- Cryo's orientation is known from environmental cues (walls, lockers, doors, ruins throughout the ship)
- Cryo orbits with all other ruins but is exempt from coupling effects (lockOrientation / O)
- Acts as the player's compass — compare any ruin's orientation against cryo to gauge its state

**Symbol readout:**
- The terminal beside the cypher shows the cryo plate with its symbol alongside the other symbols
- Symbols can be used together, so the readout looks complex
- But a player who's been paying attention to environmental cryo symbolism will recognize the correct orientation

## Known Issues
- **Allow Delete checkboxes share state** — all Allow Delete toggles (Scenes, Inventory, Puzzles, Ideograms) control the same `delete-enabled` class on the panel body. Checking one enables delete buttons across all sections. Works in practice since only one section is visible at a time, but the puzzle/ideogram views share a panel — checking Allow Delete in one persists when toggling to the other.

## Roadmap

The goal is to build **4–5 stories** using the Parallax engine, resulting in approximately **45 minutes to 1 hour of gameplay**.

The engine is feature-complete for game creation — the current focus is building the puzzle systems:

- **Ruin Codex** — the primary puzzle type, built using the ideogram editor. The ruin codex is designed to be a recurring puzzle mechanic reused across all stories. The cypher tool (disc + spindial) is complete; remaining components are the IsoMark workspace, plate press, plate lathe, and codex display.
- **IsoPlate Press** — a smaller puzzle type, mostly built via the IsoMark compositor. Needs puzzle scene registration and asset type wiring.
- **Third puzzle type** — TBD, one more smaller puzzle to round out the set.

All inventory items and puzzle assets are lined up for the current puzzle set.

## TODO
- [ ] Custom mouse cursors — replace default browser cursors with themed artwork (hand, magnifying glass, crosshair, etc.)
- [ ] Expand puzzle overlay theme — style the puzzle panel and background to match the game's atmosphere (frosted glass, glow effects, themed borders)
- [ ] Expand dialogue box theme — richer styling, character portraits or speaker names, multiple dialogue styles per context
- [ ] Sound effects: cryo pod lid opening — attach audio to the cryo pod state change transition
- [ ] Sound effects: console puzzle — keyboard typing sounds, error beep, success chime for the terminal asset
- [ ] **Ideogram Puzzle System** — the map puzzle is now the **Ideogram Puzzle**, built using the ideogram editor. Two workspace modes accessed via ideogram cards:
  - **Blank workspace** (current) — freeform canvas for building ideogram geometry, placing ruins, cutting, compositing, and general design work
  - [ ] **IsoMark Workspace** — a pre-organized workspace with designated areas for each puzzle component; selecting a card opens this structured layout where the puzzle components live together. The workflow: build an ideogram → cut ruins out of it → stamp ruin plates on the press → clear plates on the lathe → reference the codex → use the spindial to cycle/flip/rotate ruins into position
  - Puzzle components (registered as puzzle asset types, similar to combo lock):
    - [ ] **IsoMark Plate Press** — mostly built via the IsoMark compositor (applies a ruin onto an empty plate to create an isomarked plate); needs puzzle scene and asset type registration
    - [ ] **IsoMark Plate Lathe** — clears the ruin from an isomarked plate (resets it to blank); needs puzzle scene and asset type registration
    - [x] **Spindial Mechanism** — built as the Cypher tool: disc cypher with slot boxes for cycling ruins, spindial overlay for rotating the linked ruin, drag-to-rotate gesture, cardinal direction snapping, dev lock mode, solve lock, 3-tier coupling system (disc-orientation, linked spindial, mirror) with per-slot lock controls and smooth coupling animation
    - [ ] **Codex Display** — displays the ideogram geometry for the player to reference while working
  - Plate images already exist as assets; press and lathe just need puzzle scenes and registration as puzzle parts
- [ ] **Two-finger scroll rotation** — hover over a cypher/spindial in dev lock mode and use two-finger trackpad scroll to rotate it (alternative to click-drag-rotate); uses the existing `wheel` event
